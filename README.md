# Wireless_Tank_Level_Monitor

The aim of this system is to wirelessly monitor water level in a storage tank, automatically turn on pump when water level is low, 
turn off pump when level is high and switch between too power sources which are Grid and Solar setup.

This system consists of two main parts: the Sensor unit and the Controller unit. 
- The sensor unit is the part which is attached to the water tank to monitor the water level.
- The controller unit is located where you have the control panel for your water pump.

The sensor unit streams data (water level â€“ over Bluetooth) to the controller for appropriate water pumping decision to be carried out.
